# Heartdisease_data_handling
Heart Disease dataset is loaded into database(SQLite3) and normalize it and fetch the data from the data base and apply ML algorithms ( Bagging, Boosting, SVM, Naive bayes, Decision Trees) and plot the graph using python, pandas and sklearn.

There are 4 inputs:
1. Path to the csv file.
2.delimiter
3.whether the data set file has header or not.
4. have to omit first column or not.

Glance:
It automatically create the data base by taking the file name.
creates the table name:
find the data type of each column in the table.
Clean the data and loads the default value when null is present.
Insert the records.

Data visualization of the data.

ML algorithms (NB,SVM,KNN,Bagging,Boosting)
Implemented feature selection model(Mutual Information).
